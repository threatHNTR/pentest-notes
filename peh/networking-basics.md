# Networking Basics

## 1. Identifying Device Information

* **Using `ifconfig` to View IP and MAC Addresses:** The command `ifconfig` allows us to inspect network interfaces on a device. It provides essential details such as the IP address and MAC address of the device.

* **IP Address vs. MAC Address:**
  * **IP Address (Layer 3):** This is a logical address assigned to network interfaces for communication within an IP network. It enables devices to identify and communicate with each other over a network.
  * **MAC Address (Layer 2):** Also known as the physical address, the MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communication at the data link layer of a network segment. It's used for delivering data within a local network segment.

* **Understanding MAC Address Structure:** The MAC address consists of six pairs of hexadecimal digits, where the first three pairs represent the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI). This OUI can be used to determine the vendor or manufacturer of the network interface card (NIC).

## 2. Network Layers and Protocols

* **Layer 4 Protocols:**
  * **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between devices. It ensures that data packets are delivered accurately and in sequence.
  * **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** UDP, in contrast, is a connectionless protocol. It delivers data packets without establishing a connection. While UDP is faster and simpler, it lacks some of the reliability features of TCP.

* **TCP Three-Way Handshake:**
  * The TCP three-way handshake is a method used by TCP to establish a connection between a client and a server. It involves three steps:
    1. **SYN (Synchronize) Packet:** The client sends a SYN packet to the server to initiate a connection.
    2. **SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledgment) Packet:** The server responds with a SYN-ACK packet, acknowledging the client's request and simultaneously requesting a connection.
    3. **ACK (Acknowledgment) Packet:** Finally, the client sends an ACK packet to acknowledge receipt of the server's response. At this point, the connection is established, and data transfer can begin.

## 3. Common Ports and Protocols

* **TCP Ports and Associated Protocols:**
  * **FTP (21):** File Transfer Protocol, used for transferring files between a client and server.
  * **SSH (22):** Secure Shell, provides secure remote access and command execution.
  * **Telnet (23):** Telnet is a network protocol used for remote terminal connections.
  * **SMTP (25):** Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, used for sending email messages.
  * **DNS (53):** Domain Name System, resolves domain names to IP addresses.
  * **HTTP (80):** Hypertext Transfer Protocol, used for transmitting web pages and other resources on the World Wide Web.
  * **HTTPS (443):** Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, provides secure communication over a computer network.
  * **POP3 (110):** Post Office Protocol version 3, used for receiving emails from a remote server.
  * **SMB (139, 445):** Server Message Block, facilitates file sharing, printer sharing, and communication between devices.
  * **IMAP (143):** Internet Message Access Protocol, used for retrieving emails from a mail server.

* **UDP Ports and Associated Protocols:**
  * **DNS (53):** As mentioned earlier, DNS also operates over UDP for certain types of queries.
  * **DHCP (67, 68):** Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, used for dynamically assigning IP addresses to devices on a network.
  * **TFTP (69):** Trivial File Transfer Protocol, a simple file transfer protocol with minimal security features.
  * **SNMP (161):** Simple Network Management Protocol, used for managing and monitoring network devices.
