# Linux Basics

## 1. Common Network Commands

View IP addresses, interfaces, and other network configuration details

```
ifconfig
```

Alternative to ifconfig, as it is deprecated.
Use 'ip a' to show IP addresses, 'ip n' to display the ARP table, and 'ip r' to view the routing table

```
ip
```

Command for configuring wireless network interfaces

```
iwconfig
```

Ping any specified address to test network connectivity

```
ping 10.0.0.5
```

Display IP addresses and MAC addresses communicating with our machine

```
arp -a
```

Check network ports and associated services

```
netstat -ano
```

Print the routing table

```
route
```

## 2. Installing and Updating Tools

Update and upgrade installed packages

```
apt update && apt upgrade
```

Install a specific tool or package using apt package manager

```
apt install python-pip
```

Clone a repository from GitHub. Typically stored in /opt directory

```
git clone https://github.com/Dewalt-arch/pimpmykali.git
```

Execute a shell script to set up or customize a Kali Linux environment

```
./pimpmykali.sh
```

## 3. Creating and Editing Files

Print "hello" in the terminal

```
echo "hello"
```

Write "hey" to a file called hey.txt

```
echo "hey" > hey.txt
```

Read and display the content of the file

```
cat hey.txt
```

Append "hey again" to the existing content of hey.txt

```
echo "hey again" >> hey.txt
```

## 4. Bash Script Examples

Check if user provided any input

```
#!/bin/bash
if [ "$1" == "" ]
then
        echo "You forgot to specify an IP address!"
        echo "Syntax: ./ipsweep.sh 10.0.2"
else
        # Iterate through IP range from 1 to 254
        for ip in `seq 1 254`; do 
                # Ping the concatenated IP, extract reachable IPs, and remove ":" from MAC addresses
                # Run the command in the background using the ampersand to speed up the process
                ping -c 1 $1.$ip | grep "64 bytes" | cut -d " " -f 4 | tr -d ":" &
        done
fi
```

- Grant execution permissions to the script
- The script's output can be redirected to a file: ./ipsweep.sh 10.0.2 > iplist.txt
- chmod +x ipsweep.sh

One-liner example
Perform an Nmap scan on each IP listed in iplist.txt, targeting port 80

```
for ip in $(cat iplist.txt); do nmap -p 80 -sS -T4 $ip & done
```
